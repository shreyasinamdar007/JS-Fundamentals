Code Execution in JS.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++ Javascript Execution Context +++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

[{}] => Global EC <- this
-> Global Execution Context
-> Functional Execution Context
-> Eval Execution Context

[{}] -> Memory Creation Phase (Allocation of memory)
     -> Execution Phase 

Process: 1) Global Execution -> this 

         2) Memory Phase 
            val1 -> undefined   
            val2 -> undefined
            addnum -> definition
            result1 -> undefined   
            result2 -> undefined
         
         3) Execution Phase
            val1 <- 10
            val2 <- 5
            addnum -> new variable environment + Execution thread -> Memory Phase1 -> Execution Context1
